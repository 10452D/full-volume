# Full Volume

This repository holds all software developed by VEX IQ Robotics Competition (VIQRC) Team 10452D - Digital Dragons for the 2023-2024: Full Volume season.

## Who are we?

Digital Dragons are a team from the [Haslett Robotics Club](https://haslettrobotics.com/) in [Haslett, Michigan, USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haslett,_Michigan), made up of 4th graders from [Ralya Elementary School](https://www.haslett.k12.mi.us/ralya). We compete in the Elementary School Division of the [VEX IQ Robotics Competition](https://www.vexrobotics.com/iq/competition/viqc-current-game). This is our 1st year of competition.

## What's here?

This repository contains all programs created by the team as part of this season, and serves to document the iterative engineering process used. We've used the following structure to keep things organized at a high level

```
blocks_projects/      Contains any VEXCode IQ Blocks Projects
|-> integrated/       Contains blocks projects meant for overall control of the robot
|-> submodules/       Contains blocks projects only meant to control one portion of the robot
|-> sandbox/          Contains blocks projects used for learning concepts and anything else not related to the competition robot
python_projects/      Contains any VEXCode IQ Python Projects
|-> integrated/       Contains Python projects meant for overall control of the robot
|-> submodules/       Contains Python projects only meant to control one portion of the robot
|-> sandbox/          Contains Python projects used for learning concepts and anything else not related to the competition robot
